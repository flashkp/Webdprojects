        <h1>This Is My First Article</h1>
        <p> Just about every great comic book story has a darkest hour moment: a point in the tale where all seems lost. The heroes are on their knees, the city's a smouldering ruin and the villains are closing in for the kill. For Marvel, its darkest hour came in the winter of 1996.</p>
        <p>A company that had grown in stature throughout the 60s, 70s and 80s thanks to the often stunning art and storytelling in such comics as Fantastic Four and The Amazing Spider-Man, Marvel's financial success had reached a peak by the early 90s. But then a series of bursting financial bubbles and questionable business deals saw Marvel's stock value collapse; shares once worth $35.75 each in 1993 had sunk to $2.375 three years later. An ugly fight between a group of very rich investors followed, and for a while, the company's future seemed uncertain.</p>
        <p>Yet somehow, Marvel fought through all the corporate intrigue which dogged the company in late 1996 and for many long months afterwards, and emerged from the rubble a decade later as a film industry behemoth.</p>

        <h1>This Is Another Article</h1>
        <p>Avengers: Endgame was always going to mark the final Marvel Cinematic Universe appearance for some of the original Avengers, but Iron Man's death still gave fans a complete emotional shock.Tony Stark has been in the MCU since the very beginning, and if you needed to know the affection fans had for Robert Downey Jr, the uproar of cheers in cinemas everywhere when his name appeared proved it. The love is real.</p>
        <p>But those same fans should have seen Endgame's big moment coming. In fact, it seems that his fate was sealed from the very beginning of the MCU.Tony's development from basic egomaniac to risking his life for the sake of humanity is one of the most heartbreaking and gratifying character arcs you'll witness in a superhero franchise.</p>
        <p>And while Endgame probably wasn't even in the thoughts of Marvel at the time of Iron Man, you can see how Tony's eventual death was foreshadowed from the start of his arc.Take what Tony said to Pepper Potts in the first movie as a prime example: "I shouldn't be aliveâ€¦ unless it was for a reason. I'm not crazy, Pepper. I just finally know what I have to do. And I know it in my heart that it's right."</p>
